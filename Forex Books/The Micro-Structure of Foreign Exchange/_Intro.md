## Intro
**Physical Trade -x-> Turnover**
**Turnover -> Volatility** 
****turnover = total value of currency transactions over a certain period***

Physical Trade volume between 2 countries does not determine the volatility
Examples discussed 
CAD/USD - Cad has large number of trade with US, but still it has less market turnover compared to US. Trade between countries cannot determine the turnover in a currency.
Turnover depends  on global financial use, status.
Dutch Gilder - pegged to German, also German has more turnover so there is no need to trade Dutch when you can get same result from German. 

**MDH (Mixture of Distribution hypothesis)**
Volume and volatility are not co-related, both come into play whenever news come.

**Tauchen and Pitts Theory**
When more people trade and news comes faster, people differ more, turnover goes up and linked with volatility. 

**ISD (Implied Standard Deviation)** 
You can get future volatility from Options pricing (using Black-Scholes)
