### 1.3.1 Time series for volatility 

1. Today's variance based on 
	- Baseline variance 
	- Yesterday's surprise 
	- Yesterday's volatility 
2. A big shock today increases the variance tomorrow 
3. Over long period variance settle around constant variable 
4. Half Life of Shock is 17 days 

Note 
***It was tested on previous data which is not similar to ISD*** 

### 1.3.2 Time series  for Volume 

Predict the expected volume by removing unexpected volume 
Process Required 

Is Volume Stable -> Yes it is 

Build The Model -> Split the volume in 2 part 
	Long Term : Volume rise 9% annually (1985 - 1992)
	Short Term : Volume depends on last 2 days + random shock 

Expected vs Un-Expected Volume 
	Predicts tomorrow's volume based on long term and past term -> Expected Volume 
	Extra movement happens is unexpected shock
