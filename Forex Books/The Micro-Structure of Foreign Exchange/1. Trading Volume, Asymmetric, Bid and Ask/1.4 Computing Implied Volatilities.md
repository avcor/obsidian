Black Sholes gives option price after putting some variable, but inverting the formula it gives the implied volatility.
Only ATM (at -the-money) options price is used which has high Vega.
Put and call options are considered then averaged out  because it cancels out the difference b/w ask and bid. 

Black Black-Scholes only good if volatility is not random, but if it changes in deterministic fashion then it could be calculated over average over time.  But if it is stochastic, then this model fails in theory. 

Other methods had been tried like Monte-Carlo simulation (total fail) and Heston theory (complex).  But Black scholes is simple and gives sufficient approximation of ISD
