MDH postulates relation b/w volume and volatility. Both depends on news but cannot directly measure news, so volume is used as proxy for news. 

GARCH 
Model that captures volatility clustering 
volume clustering: if yesterday has high volatility today will be high & vice-versa 

**Lamoureux & Lastrapes (1990) study**
Generally this shows effect of financial data. But when you add the volume into model as an extra variable the GARCH effect vanished. This means it is not some magic clustering, but it is just rate of information arrival and volume can be used as proxy for it. 

GARCH + volume - backward looking, real time 
IV - forward looking, 

**Spread** 
- Friday/holiday dummy: spreads ↑ 
- Implied variance ↑ → spreads ↑
- GARCH variance ↑ → spreads ↑
- Expected volume ↑ → spreads ↓
