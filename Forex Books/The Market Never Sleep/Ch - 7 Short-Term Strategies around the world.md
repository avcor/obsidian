### Stocks and how I play them for the short term  
- Stock which you heard, know something about it and product
- ATR of 1$ of daily trading session 
- 2 to 3 million shares of stock must trade each day. 
- *Beta is statistical volatility measure; reflects how stock ranks compared to over all market. By definition market has beta of 1.*
  Less than 1 -> low volatility to market 
  = 2 -> twice volatility to market (great volatility means higher risk)
  For short term must have high volatility more than 2 
- Stock is trending with market sector plus agreement with general market 
  Exception some stock may not follow this rule. Oils rises, equity market goes down. 
- Know stock's personality, become familiar but do not marry
