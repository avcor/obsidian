## Declarative 
- It is a function of state `UI = f(state)`
- Describe UI for a given state
- It decides how to update the UI effectively - (it diffing algorithm)
- Unidirectional Flow - State Flows down, event flows up 
## Imperative 
- We need to manually mutate view like hiding the view, setting the text 
- Need to manually instruct how UI will change 
- Null pointer Exception if not found using `findViewById` or forget to initialize.
- Bidirectional Flow - Input/Output are handled manually
