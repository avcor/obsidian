The system or app sends broadcast when particular event occurs 

### Receive the broadcast 
#### 1. Context Registered Broadcast 
Valid till the context is registered

**Registering**
For registering the broadcast you need Androix Core Library 
```
val filter = IntentFilter("com.example.snippets.ACTION_UPDATE_DATA")
ContextCompat.RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED

ContextCompat.registerReceiver(context, myBroadcastReceiver, filter, receiverFlags)
```
For composable to split between stateful and stateless version 
```
@Composable
fun MyStatefulScreen() {
    val myBroadcastReceiver = remember { MyBroadcastReceiver() }
    val context = LocalContext.current
    LifecycleStartEffect(true) {
        // ...
        ContextCompat.registerReceiver(context, myBroadcastReceiver, filter, flags)
        onStopOrDispose { context.unregisterReceiver(myBroadcastReceiver) }
    }
    MyStatelessScreen()
}

@Composable
fun MyStatelessScreen() {
    // Implement your screen
}
```
**UnRegister**
While broadcast receiver is  registered it holds the reference to context this can potentially cause leak if the registered scope exceeds the lifecycle scope of context. E.g. forget to unregister  in activity. 
*What will happen*
Broadcast receiver holds the strong reference to activity object. GC cannot clean it up, hence increasing RAM and reducing performance of app. The System will eventually throw and Out-Of-Memory exception and crash the app entirely. 

#### 2. Manifest - declared Receivers
```
<!-- 1. The intent filters specify the broadcast actions your receiver subscribes to. -->
<receiver android:name=".MyBroadcastReceiver" android:exported="false">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="com.example.snippets.ACTION_UPDATE_DATA" />
    </intent-filter>
</receiver>
```
