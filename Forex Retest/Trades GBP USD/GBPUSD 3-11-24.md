Circle 1 – It is close to proper support with RSI under threshold, also It is under SMA –50  

For SMA –50 last one increasing, second last one was from strong down (exhausted one).  

Even volume justified the down trend  

My justification could be I should take the last momentum and should have taken the buy position till SMA –50
