### Premise  
- Broke Support / Resistance
	+ largely visibly overbought or oversold 
	+ If RSI is outside threshold (70 -30)
	+ Broke the support and resistance 
	+ Volume must be high before and after breaking
	+ After RSI coming normal, price should be in zone  
	
	-> Price will continue

### Conditions
- It is better if SMA-50 is in direction (Approx 10 days )
- Volume should be high 🔼

### Things to look out 
- Beware, when it already happened in past once when in sideways
- 2nd oversold or overbought could be reversal. 
  But it should be edge of S/R 🚩
###  Example Trades  
- [[GBPUSD 6-3-24]]
