### No One know offline flow 
When I received this task, I was told that iOS only had the offline flow, not android. Even I believed that there was no flow. But when I started to deep dive in the code I found that there was implementation of it. I raised the concern to QA and Lead to know if it was correct. Even they have no idea of it, As I spend more time with it, I get to know to it was implemented partially, not the complete flow. Even that was a total mess, more than 2000 line of code in single file, and those file around to be 10. It was a total nightmare to work in this module as it was difficult to understand and debug. 

### Partial offline flow 
Just to confirm if it is correct, I found that it was implemented partially and some part of it are wrong. 

### Updating deadline
As soon as I found that there is support of offline I informed to lead. Help him to estimate the new updated deadline for 2 scenarios if we had to take in consideration of offline support or not. 

### Completing Offline
I understood the criticality of feature from business stand point. I know this feature is some game changer for the company. I took responsibility and gave commitment to fix this feature ASAP. I have negotiated with deadline, committed to complete the work on time. 
1. I said I will 
2. I meant it 
3. I actually did it 
See I have 2 options at deciding moment, if I can do it or leave it. 
At that moment I understood the importance of this feature from business stand point. I Chose to complete it even I could be escaped from extra work.  
I choose to complete it as will solve the critical problem faced by this android feature, and will be boon for the company.  I knew it is string that will pull the customer trust over the app, and might leave a strong bold between customer and organisation. 

### Implementing new flow
With such critical task and tight deadline I have implemented new flow with offline flow, under the deadline. I went extra mile so that it could be completed with iOS. 

### Commitment to deadline 
There were times when project completion was in doubt, there lot of breaking in feature. I was still had option to go back and just revert it and simply complete the feature with basic functionality. I stuck with my commitment and finally completed the feature. The time taken was same with iOS, thus without damaging the deadline.
