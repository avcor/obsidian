what I have observed SMA generally forms up Channels in trend, in channels when price reaches to maximum, RSI is under the threshold. Whenever price fails to reach the end the of channel, with oversold there are chances that it might take reversal.
Over here outside the threshold is not the little ones, but the large visible ones .
