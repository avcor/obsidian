### Premise  
- Slope of SMA-50 
- Ideally you can take 3 trade, after first price hike 
- Last momentum should be taken into consideration
- This could be combined with [[RSI Under Threshold]] 
	- Up Trend -> Price goes under trend 
	- Down Trend -> vice-versa 
- (Experimental) If RSI is oversold in a trend, there could movement sideways for some time 

### Conditions
- 1 month duration for a particular direction, after that there is side wave. At the end of month movement starts to change toward side waves.
- Up Trend 
	- Up Trend -> Sideways -> Up Trend (low chances)  
	- Up Trend -> Sideways -> Down Trend (mid chances)
	- Up Trend -> Up Trend (Rare chances)
- Down Trend 
	- vice-versa
- If S/R is broken twice in sideways, SMA consideration should be taken.
	- e.g. - resistance has broken twice, it should no longer taken into consideration.
	  Next support should be taken into SMA.
	  [[GBPUSD 21-2-24]]

### Things to look out 
- Total 4 hike (rarely 5)
- Slope determines if it will go in that direction 
	- Transgression 
		- [[GBPUSD 10-4-24]]

### Entry Point 
- Close to SMA
- After price hike in trend, then in consolidation 

### Take profit 
- Same as previous hike 

### Stop loss 
- Close to recent S/R, below / above SMA
- 50%, 75% of previous hike 

###  Example Trades  
- With [[RSI Under Threshold]] -> [[GBPUSD 3-11-24]]
- With [[RSI Outside Threshold]] -> [[GBPUSD 6-3-24]]
