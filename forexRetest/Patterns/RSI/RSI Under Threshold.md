	+ RSI touched extremes 
	+ Under threshold (70 - 30)
	+ Did not break resistance or support 
	+ Volume must be high close to Support or Resistance
	
	-> Price will come down 
	
- Outside Support / Resistance
	- RSI touched extremes 
	- Under Threshold 
	- Volume around avg
	
	-> Price will follow a drop to closest support / resistance and return to original

### Things to look out
