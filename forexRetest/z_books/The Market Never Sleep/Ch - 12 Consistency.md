### Use global Information 
### Consistency requires a plan 
The strategy or plan must be as detailed as possible. How much will
you risk? How many shares or contracts will be traded? When will you
trade? What will you trade? How will you determine entry, exit, and profit targets? To what extent will you rely on fundamentals? Technical? 
### Consistency requires following the plan 
### Stay in the comfort zone 
### Don't risk more than 2/3 of you winning in after noon 
### Discard Bias 
To trade successfully you need to have long term, intermediate term, short term vision of market at all the times. Then compare your bias or opinion with the actual numbers to determine whether the number support or refute your bias. 

When market opened today ->
price were above or down yearly opening ?
above or below monthly? 
weeks open!
yesterdays open! 
How Asia and Europe traded last night

   Mark calendar green if day was profit, red if loss, yellow nothing is taken
3. Strategy three: Respect Risk 
   Before clicking the mouse, identify 3 points: **entry point**, **profit target** and **emergency exit point** (it is the point which when you are wrong)
