## The Power of Supply and Demand

- ### Interest Rates and Why They Matter 
	- Rates have the power to move equity, commodity, currency, bonds etc 
	- When rates rise, lender win and borrower losses. But consumer will borrow less and industry too. The hiring, purchase, expansion will delayed. Business will shrink, unemployment rise, and recession will follow 
	  On other hand, companies rush to lend money, to expand. Labor market may be pushed, making wages high, igniting inflation. This will result in slower growth 
	  It has to be in between 

- ### When the Fed speaks, People Listen 
	- When interest rate increases -> sell off equities. Once market digest it come back to normal 
	- When rates are lowered -> higher equities. Then It come back to normal
	- ***Sometimes it is reverse of what is expected. Author advice novice trader not to trade news especially fed news***

- ### Other Repercussion of Rate Increase
	- Bonds
	  Inflation -> deteriorates the value of bonds 
	  Rising Interest rate -> higher yield for newly issued bonds 
	  -> when traders believe that rates are topping off, many will buy them, because when they decline it will be golden and sold at premium. 
	- Currency Market 
	  Higher rate -> more foreign capital 
	  Lower rate -> vice versa. May be better return in other places
